## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Computer Engineering student at PUC-Rio, very much interested in learning more about computer networks and working with them.

I've worked with Data Science in a project at ExACTa-FIT for Eletrobras in the past, and learned a lot about how to handle datasets with inconsistent formatting and limited structure, developing skills in data cleaning and preprocessing.

I've developed projects both personal and for university that involved a varied set of things, going from games and 3D modelling to low level assembly and a syntax analyzer for a custom programming language.

I'm always open to learn more! I really appreciate the things I can learn from the people I work with so I'm always down to work with new and unfamiliar projects (*as may be apparent by now*). 

Currently I'm focused on my studies, and plan to continue in my academic route towards a degree at first, with hopes for a Master's abroad.
